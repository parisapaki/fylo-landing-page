# 🌐 Fylo Landing Page

Hi! This is my **first ever project** in the world of programming and web development 🎉

## ✨ About the Project

I built this landing page using **pure HTML and CSS**, along with **Bootstrap** for some components and layout help.  
It was a great learning experience for me to get familiar with structuring a webpage and styling it from scratch.

## 💡 Features

- Built using **HTML**, **pure CSS**, and **Bootstrap**
- Uses **custom fonts** and **various images**
- Fully **responsive design** — works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Clean and organized code structure
